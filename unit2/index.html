<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

<p>It was difficult for me to choose from the various websites that inspire me, but two I visit most frequently are:</p>

<uL>
	<li><strong><a href="http://food52.com">Food52.com</a></strong></li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify.com</a></strong></li>
</ul>


<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

<h3>Food52.com</h3>
<p><strong>Space:</strong> This site has a lot of content on the homepage, but the white space around the positive space creates a visually appealing view.</p>

<p><strong>Size:</strong> Food52.com utilizes size effectively. Their logo is prominent, but not overbearing on the left hand side of their site. There are a number of large images that scroll across the page above the fold. They bring the visitors focus immediately to this element.</p>

<p><strong>Balance:</strong> The negative and positive space work great together on Food52.com making the page easily readable. Food52.com also uses a very simple color scheme which allows for images of food and drinks on the site to draw more attention.
	</p>

	<h3>Spotify.com</h3>

	<p><strong>Space:</strong>This site has a really interesting use of space. The entire website is set over various images that change as you scroll down through the page. This sounds like it could be confusing and a mess, but Spotify.com pulls their design off seamlessly. As you scroll over the images, you cross over large white boxes with text and images making the background images secondary in the design.</p>

	<p><strong>Size:</strong> Size is primarily represented on Spotify.com through their text. They use the same font throughout the site, but an increased size is used to create headers. </p>

<p><strong>Balance:</strong> Balance is also an interestng aspect of this site. Spotify.com uses both symmetrical and asymmetrical design. Asymmetrical is used first in the large white boxes. The text takes up about 75% of the white space with an image complimenting the words. The very bottom of Spotify.com, where a visitor can take action to purchase the product, is symmetrical. The break down of the Free and Premium programs both take up the same amount of space.
</p>


<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

<p><strong>Differences:</strong> You can tell that each website serves its own product. Food52.com is set up so you can scroll fast and find content that catches your eye. On Spotify.com, you're continuously scrolling in one direction learning about a single product.
</p>
<p>
	Spotify also uses just one website, where Food52 uses multiple.
</p>

<p><strong>Similarities:</strong>
	Both websites have their logos on the top, left hand side. They each follow strong brand color schemes and have great use of white space.</p>
