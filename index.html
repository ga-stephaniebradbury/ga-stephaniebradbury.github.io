<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
I'm an Email Marketing Manager, living in New York City. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development when I first taught myself to hack MySpace in the early 2000s before the site gave users the ability to edit the style of their own profiles. My basic HTML skills were a major boost in helping me land a job in my major (marketing communications) quickly after graduating in 2008. My career kicked off managing an email program and web content for a growing website.
</p>


<h2>My Mission</h2>

<p>
As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Senior Manager remaining on the digital team with my current company, New York Road Runners, because I love my current environment where everyone is a go-getter and genuinely care about their work and impact in the community. It's always been a dream of mine to be a freelancer as well where I could work one-on-one in a more personal atmosphere with clients building websites for families, professionals in the arts, and special events.
